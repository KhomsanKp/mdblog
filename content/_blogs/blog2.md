[Apple released the 7th generation of iPad mini, which was introduced with an A17 Pro chipset, also seen on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, the official website states something different - the tablet has only a 5-core GPU, which seems like a downgraded version of the A17 Pro.]{.text-subtitle}

Chipsets like these are often called binned because they do not pass the same quality control process during manufacturing. It is highly possible that the version with a 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU was not powerful enough for the iPhones, but there was a big enough batch to equip the new iPads.

We also have to point out that Apple discontinued the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max after launching the 16 Pro duo, meaning there might be an extra couple of chips initially set aside for the phones.

The chip would still perform well, just with one core deactivated to keep up with performance. Given that it is the A17 Pro, we expect the iPad mini (2024) to have Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 once it launches. The tablet is up for pre-order with a starting price of $499, and sales will begin on October 23.
